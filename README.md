# GEASI Demo
This repository contains a minimal working example of our algorithm presented in [GEASI: Geodesic-based Earliest Activation Sites Identification in cardiac models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09962). The main steps of the algorithm are similar, but to offer a concise and short code some simplifying assumptions were made (see Limitations).

The method is demonstrated in [GEASI_Grid.ipynb](GEASI_Grid.ipynb), whereas [utils.py](utils.py) contains some utility functions to keep the code short. The presented problem is similar to the square-domain example of the paper with slightly varying results due to the deviations from the original algorithm.

# Installation

The notebook can be viewed in github or using jupyter-notebook/-lab. To execute the code, some packages need to be installed to compute the eikonal equation .

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04. To run, switch to the repository directory and execute the following commands in a fresh python environment (e.g. virtual-env, or anaconda).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-notebook
```


# Limitations
While this repository is meant as a demonstration of the algorithm, several simplifications were made to make the code as short and concise as possible in contrast to the original paper:
- Projection directly from L-BFGS-B method instead of the Moreau-envelope
- A structured grid is used instead of a true FEM mesh
- \nabla \phi is estimated using a finite difference scheme
- Only the isotropic eikonal equation is considered, i.e. |\nabla \phi| = 1/v and solved using [skfmm](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fmm/)
- We assume quadrilateral basis functions inside the grid
- Contains neither the topological gradient, nor the ECG extension
- No handling of coalescing EASs
